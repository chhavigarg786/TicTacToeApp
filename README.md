3. Once You are done with the feature, test it to make sure it works without any issues
4. Create a Pull request (once approved this will merge your branch with the main branch)
5. Notify others so they can review changes (at least 1 review and approval is required before merging is allowed)
6. Once Approved your branch will be merged to main
7. Delete the old branch, now your features are added to the main project. (so the repo is not cluttered with a lot of old branches)
